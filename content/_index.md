## Overview

We are implementing a NUMA simulator to measure and analyze memory access latency under different interconnect network policies and page assignment strategies. This project aims to provide insights into how NUMA architecture is implemented in practice, and how design parameters such as cache coherence protocols, interconnect topologies, and memory locality affect overall system performance.
